### About Application

As Faculty of Science, Khon Kaen University provides the education service for basic courses to students in various faculties as well as academic service activities for students and visitors throughout the year, there are a lot of people who visit the faculty. The faculty consists of several buildings in which each building is attached to a different road. So, if a visitor enters the faculty from a wrong way, he/she must rely on walkways in the faculty which are for walking between adjacent buildings. However, since there are many routes, it will be difficult for those unfamiliar with the facultyâ€™s routes to find a building or place they want to access

With that, we come up with the idea of developing a mobile application to suggest routes and school buildings of Faculty of Science to help solve such problem on Android Platform. This application utilizes Augmented Reality (AR) technologies to help represent a model of location-based buildings by using a GPS coordinate. That model is three-dimensional in order for a user to know exactly where he/she us, no matter where he/she is in the building. The application can suggest routes to different buildings inside the faculty, including the primary, secondary and shortest route, and the application is also capable of searching landmarks in the faculty, parking lot and access route to the faculty.
